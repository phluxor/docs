# install

Phluxor is available on Packagist.  
You can install it using Composer.  
*Phluxor requires PHP 8.3 or later and Swoole 5.0 or later.*  

```bash
$ composer require phluxor/phluxor
```

Phluxor can be used in various applications such as web applications and CLI applications.  
However, Phluxor itself does not have the functionality of a web server,  
so if you want to create a web application,  
you should create a web application using a Swoole HTTP server or similar(mezzio-swoole and more).
